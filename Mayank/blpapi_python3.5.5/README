Bloomberg Python API version 3.5
================================

This directory contains an interface for interacting with Bloomberg API
services using the Python programming language.


Dependencies
------------

This SDK requires the following products:

- CPython version 2.6 or 2.7

- Bloomberg C++ SDK version 3.5 or later

- Visual C++ 2008 or 2010 (Windows) or GCC 4.1+ (Linux)


Installation
------------

Note that installation requires a working C compiler and the C headers
distributed as part of the Bloomberg C++ SDK.

1. Set the `BLPAPI_ROOT` environment variable to the location at which the
   Bloomberg C++ SDK is installed. (On Windows, this location may be of the
   form `C:\blp\API\APIv3\C++API\v3.5.2.1\`.)

2. To compile and install the `blpapi` Python package for all users, run

       > python setup.py install

   To compile and install the `blpapi` Python package for only the current
   user, run

       > python setup.py install --user

   (Note that the former command requires root/administrator access, while the
   latter does not.)

   Documentation on additional build and installation options is available by
   running

       > python setup.py --help

3. (optional) Copy the C++ SDK shared library/DLL to a standard library
   location (e.g. `/usr/lib` on Linux), or update the system-wide library path
   (configured by `/etc/ld.so.conf` on Linux and by setting the `PATH`
   environment variable on Windows) to include the directory containing the
   C++ SDK library.  Note that this step is not necessary for users who already
   have a system-wide installation of the C++ SDK, including Windows users who
   have the Bloomberg Terminal software installed.


Writing Bloomberg API Programs in Python
----------------------------------------

In order for python scripts to call Bloomberg API functions, the libraries
distributed as part of the Bloomberg C++ SDK must be available to the Python
interpreter.  Step 3 of installation, above, provides system-wide installation
of this library. Linux/Solaris/*nix users without system-wide installations
must set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Darwin/MacOS X)
environment variable to include the directory containing the `blpapi3` shared
libraries.  Windows users may need to set the `PATH` variable to the
directory containing `blpapi3_32.dll` or `blpapi3_64.dll`. (Note that Windows
users with the Bloomberg Terminal software installed already have versions of
these libraries in their `PATH`.)

After installation, the `blpapi` module can be imported by a Python script or
within the CPython interpreter:

    >>> import blpapi
    >>> options = blpapi.SessionOptions()
    >>> options.setServerHost('localhost')
    >>> options.setServerPort(8194)
    >>> session = blpapi.Session(options)
    >>> session.start()

Note that many Python installations add the current directory to the module
search path. If the Python interpreter is invoked from the installer directory,
such a configuration will attempt to use the (incomplete) local `blpapi`
directory as a module. If the above `import` line fails with the message
`Import Error: No module named _internals`, move to a different directory
before invoking `python`.

Documentation for individual Bloomberg API classes and functions is provided
through Python's built-in help system.

Further documentation on programming the Bloomberg API is available in the
Developer's Guide, available at <http://open.bloomberg.com>.


Examples
--------

A collection of complete Python programs covering a wide range of typical API
usage is available in the `examples` directory, located in the same directory
as this `README` file. Note that many examples make use of command-line
arguments to specify server and authentication configuration; in most cases
usage information can be obtained by passing the `--help` option on the command
line.


Implementation Notes
--------------------

- The Python Bloomberg SDK does not provide direct support for Python `unicode`
  objects. Clients can pass unicode data to SDK functions accepting strings by
  calling `u.encode('utf-8')` for an appropriate `unicode` object `u`; a string
  `s` received from an SDK function can be converted to a `unicode` object by
  calling `s.decode('utf-8')`.

- Python Bloomberg SDK types do not provide support for the Python `copy` or
  `pickle` modules.
